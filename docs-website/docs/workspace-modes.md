# Overview

This is a sample docs site for the packages in [spautz/skip-the-build](https://github.com/spautz/skip-the-build)




This used to require external scripts, brittle export paths, and a lot of care.
`skip-the-build` does it through your build system using [condition names](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/packages.html#conditional-exports)
and NodeJS's standard resolution rules.
